# Identify mutant thermostable nanobodies with conserved function

We showcase the applicability of ML models for a potential real-world application. The question we ask is: "Can we identify alternative nanobodies that (1) are more thermostable than the wildtype and (2) preserve the wildtype's function and structure?"

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Finding thermostable nanobodies is important because they offer enhanced stability under extreme conditions, making them more suitable for a variety of real-world applications, including:

#### Improved Shelf Life and Storage:

Thermostable nanobodies can be stored and transported without refrigeration, crucial for global distribution, especially in regions with limited cold-chain infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for healthcare in underdeveloped areas.

#### Enhanced Performance in Diagnostics and Therapeutics:

In diagnostic tools, thermostable nanobodies maintain functionality over a wider range of temperatures, ensuring reliability in point-of-care settings. In therapeutics, they remain effective in the human body under physiological stress, improving drug stability.

#### Industrial Applications:

Thermostable nanobodies are valuable in harsh industrial environments, such as in biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing, where high temperatures are required for certain processes.
